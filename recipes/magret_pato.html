    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The magret refers to the breast of a Moulard duck that has been reared for foie gras. A Moulard duck is a cross between a Muscovy drake and a Pekin hen, and is a sizable bird with a well-developed breast. It also is the preferred duck used to produce foie gras, because of its large size and hearty constitution.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 duck breasts</li>
        <li>6 gloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 clementine</li>
        <li>Salt flakes q.s.</li>
        <li>Black pepper q.s.</li>
        <li>Marinade juices:</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 clementine</li>
        <li>2 springs of rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tbsp blackberry jam</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of honey</li>
        <li>1 cup of vegetable broth to taste</li>
        <li>1 handful of flour</li>
        <li>1 glass of Port wine</li>
        <li>1 cup broth</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a mortar, crush six cloves of garlic and make a paste with a little clementine juice, salt and pepper flakes; Rub the duck breasts with this mixture and let them rest for around two hours in the fridge, covered with cling film</li>
        <li>hen, clean the duck breasts of excess marinade, reserving it (it will be needed for the sauce!)</li>
        <li>With a sharp knife, make a few cuts on the duck's skin, in the fat part, to create a beautiful diamond pattern; be careful not to cut through the fat and get to the meat</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan very well and start by placing the duck breasts skin side down; Once the skin is browned, flip and cook the breasts for about another 6 to 8 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, wrap in parchment paper and leave to rest in the oven at a very low temperature</li>
        <li>For the sauce, in the same frying pan where you cooked the duck, add the reserved marinade juices, the remaining clementine juice and rosemary; remove the rosemary sprigs and add the blackberry jam, honey, a little vegetable broth, flour and Port wine; mix very well and as soon as it boils, lower the heat and count for ten to fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally; we want the sauce to reduce and acquire a creamy texture; then strain this sauce into a container</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the breasts with this sumptuous sauce!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!!</p>
